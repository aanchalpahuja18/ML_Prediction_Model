# ML_Prediction_Model

## This project is all about designing & developing a Prediction model which can predict whether customer will leave AT & T organization or not.

## The ipynb file includes the following:

- Performing the EDA

- Supervised Learning Algorithms:
- Applying Naive Bayes classifier
- Applying SVM
- Evaluating the performance using
Precision, Recall, F1 score and accuracy.

- Using Artificial Neural Networks: 
- Develop a model using artificial neural network which can predict severity of airplane accident.

- Applying hyper parameter tuning to improve performance.
